# WorkoutBoss
*An x-team project for CS400*

This program will help users keep track of the workouts that they have done. It will allow them to organize and access all of the data from their workout history and allow them to view PRs. The primary users of this application would be people that workout often and those who desire to save and store their workout history. 

The program will also provide a calorie count of each submitted workout, calculated based on unique algorithms for each workout. This will allow users to see what their most successful workouts have been.

The application will utilize a linked list as its primary data structure. One linked list will store workouts by date. Additionally, to keep track of the PRs, there will be another linked list that stores them and is updated.
