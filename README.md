# WorkoutBoss
*An x-team project for CS400*

This program will help users keep track of the workouts that they have done. It will allow them to organize and access all of the data from their workout history and allow them to view PRs. The primary users of this application would be people that workout often and those who desire to save and store their workout history. 

Collaborators: Ayaz Franz, Max Newcomer, Megan Choy, and Lucas Buttazoni
